## Performing Green Energy analysis to make an informed decisions for investments

Steve being a recent graduate with a Finance degree, his parents approached him to assist them with their investment.  His parents are passionate about the Green Energy sector.  They believe fossil fuels will eventually deplete, therefore will be more dependant on alternate energy.  There are four components of the Green Energy sector; Hydro, Geothermal, Wind and Bio.  However Steve's parents has not done alot of research and therefore wanted to invest in DAQO New Energy Corp. who manufactures silicon waffels for solar panels.

Steve, as their financial advisor is hesitant and would like to diversify his parents' investment by analyzing deeper for all stocks for energy companies including DAQO's stocks to make a more informed decision.
